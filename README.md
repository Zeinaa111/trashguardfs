# TrashGuardFS

TrashGuardFS is a simple, cross-platform command-line tool written in Java that helps you locate and clean "trash" or unnecessary folders from your file system.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world application of operating system concepts like:

* File and directory management
* Permission handling
* Command-line interface interaction
* Platform-independent file operations

By simulating how operating systems handle trash or temporary data cleanup, TrashGuardFS offers a practical learning experience tied directly to OS fundamentals.

## Features

* Recursively scans directories for trash folders
* Prompts user before deleting anything
* Logs deleted folders for safety
* Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
* Lightweight and runs without admin rights

---

## Technologies Used

* Java SE 8+
* Java I/O & NIO APIs
* Command-Line Interface (CLI)
* Cross-platform testing on Windows

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand file system traversal, cross-platform path handling, and how OS-level file operations can be controlled and automated. It also gave me practical experience designing safe and user-friendly CLI tools.
