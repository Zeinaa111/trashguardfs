🧹 TrashGuardFS
TrashGuardFS is a simple, cross-platform command-line tool written in Java that helps you locate and clean "trash" or unnecessary folders from your file system. This project was built as part of my B206 Operating Systems final project at Gisma University of Applied Sciences.

🎯 Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world application of operating system concepts like:

File and directory management

Permission handling

Command-line interface interaction

Platform-independent file operations

By simulating how operating systems handle trash or temporary data cleanup, TrashGuardFS offers a practical learning experience tied directly to OS fundamentals.

🚀 Features
🔍 Recursively scans directories for trash folders

✅ Prompts user before deleting anything

🧾 Logs deleted folders for safety

💻 Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

⚙️ Lightweight and runs without admin rights

🛠 Technologies Used
Java SE 8+

Java I/O & NIO APIs

Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Cross-platform testing on Windows 

🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me understand file system traversal, cross-platform path handling, and how OS-level file operations can be controlled and automated. It also gave me practical experience designing safe and user-friendly CLI tools.
